# Brawl-Stars-v40-hosted

# Brawl Stars v40  Experimental Brawl Stars v40 server emulator written in Python.   


### Requirements: - Python 3.7 or higher - colorama 

 ### Running the server In a terminal, type __`pip install -r requirements.txt`__ then run the server using __`python main.py`__

 
### Configuring the client app To connect to your server, a **patched client** is required. Download this [Client](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) and change the IP in `libhaccing.config.so`. 

### Got any question? Contact @Royal_MK on Discord or open an issue.  

### Important Notice This is an experimental and incomplete server made just for fun. No database, no data saving. 
 The purpose of this project is to prove that making a private server for Brawl Stars is still possible. We won't provide further updates nor will we offer support for miss-features or other issues.
